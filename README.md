This project allowed me to understand the basics of JS and in particular how to use functions, loops, if-else and if-else keywords, and comparisons. I also trained my problem-solving skills, looking for solutions to the difficulties that presented themselves to me, tackling one critical moment at a time until I achieved my goal. The program is based on the game of paper, rock and scissors. The user will choose one of the three possibilities and the program will respond with a choice. The Game lasts 5 rounds, and at the end, whoever has the highest score wins.
