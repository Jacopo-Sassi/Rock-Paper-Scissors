This project allowed me to understand the basics of JS and in particular how to use functions, loops, if-else and if-else keywords, comparisons. I also trained my problem-solving skills, looking for solutions to the difficulties that presented themselves to me, tackling one critical moment at a time until I achieved my goal.
